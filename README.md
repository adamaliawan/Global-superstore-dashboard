# Global Superstore Dashboard Project

This project showcases a comprehensive dashboard built to analyze sales, profit, and shipping data from the Global Superstore dataset using Excel and Tableau. The focus is on providing insights into regional sales, product categories, shipping costs, and order priorities. The dashboard is designed for business decision-making, enabling users to explore sales trends, profitability, and operational efficiency.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To demonstrate the use of Tableau for creating interactive, insightful dashboards.
- To provide a detailed analysis of global sales and profits by region and product category.
- To analyze shipping costs over time and visualize order priorities.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of sales transactions from a global superstore, capturing detailed information about orders, customers, products, and shipping.

### Key Columns:
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **Region**: Geographic region where the sale was made.
- **Product Category and Sub-Category**: Classification of products sold.
- **Sales**: Total sales value for the transaction.
- **Profit**: Profit generated from the transaction.
- **Shipping Cost**: Cost incurred for shipping the order.
- **Order Priority**: Priority level of the order (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard consists of four main visualizations:
1. **Total Sales by Region**: A bar chart displaying the sales performance across different regions, helping to identify top-performing markets.
2. **Sales and Profit for Each Product Category**: A scatter plot that highlights the relationship between sales and profit for various product categories, aiding in product profitability analysis.
3. **Average Shipping Cost per Year**: A line chart illustrating the trend in shipping costs over time, providing insights into operational costs.
4. **Distribution of Order Priority**: A pie chart that shows the proportion of orders by their priority levels, useful for understanding how order urgency impacts sales and operations.

### Key Insights:
- **Sales Distribution**: Western Europe, Central America, and Oceania are the top three regions by sales volume.
- **Profitability**: Certain product categories, such as copiers and phones, show higher profitability compared to others.
- **Shipping Costs**: Shipping costs show a steady trend over the years, with a slight decrease in the latter years.
- **Order Priorities**: A significant portion of orders are medium-priority, with critical orders making up the smallest percentage.
